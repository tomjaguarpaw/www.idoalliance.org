<h2>Summary of Aims</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We assert that people have a moral right to know the truth about their
personal history.  Where the state has custody of relevant information it
has a duty not to collude in deceiving or depriving individuals of such
information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It follows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The truth about a donor-conceived person's genetic and social parentage should be recorded on their relevant public documentation.</li>
<li>In the normal course of events of life it should be impossible for a
donor-conceived person to fail to find out that they are donor-conceived.</li>
<li>The principal legal instrumentality of this should be the person's birth
certificate, which should make it clear that donor conception has taken
place.  The genetic parentage should be recorded on the certificate itself
or associated documentation available to the donor-conceived person
concerned.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>The International Donor Offspring Alliance "IDOA"</h3>
<p>IDOA was formed in 2007.  It exists to act as an advocate for those
conceived through the use of donor gametes: eggs or sperm.  It has members
from the UK, US, Canada, France, Japan, New Zealand and Australia; they
include both donor offspring and those with a professional interest, including academics and social work practitioners.</p>
<h3>What we believe</h3>
<p>IDOA believes that everyone has the right to know the truth about their own
life and that that includes the manner of their conception and the identity
of their biological parents.  Where the state is involved in providing or
regulating donor conception, it must not cause, promote or collude in
deceiving people or depriving them of information about their own origins;
nor may it discriminate against particular groups in terms of the provision
of significant information about their own lives.  It follows that the birth
certificate of a donor-conceived person must enable them to know the
identity of their biological parents.</p>
<h2>Listen to the offspring</h2>
<p>IDOA is the voice of those who know what it means to be donor-conceived.  Our experience leads us to assert that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genetic heritage has objective existence, meaning and value;</li>
<li>Everyone has a moral right to know about their genetic and biological origin and background;</li>
<li>Being deprived of that knowledge or deceived about ones origins is painful and damaging;</li>
<li>Where the state intervenes by supporting or regulating the provision of
donor gametes it has a responsibility to establish legal protection for that
moral right by ensuring that the people brought into existence by donor
conception are not deceived, nor deliberately deprived of information, about
their genetic and biological parents.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is for these reasons that birth certificates must provide accurate information.  Our proposals are as follows:</p>
<h2>Birth certificates</h2>
<p>The fundamental proposition is that people have a right to know about their
own lives and that that must include knowing who their parents are,
including their biological parents - something which has been recognised in
the case of adopted people since 1975.  That knowledge can only be
safeguarded and transmitted if it is recorded.  It is not open to recipient
parents or anyone else to decide on a child's behalf that it does not need
to know or can justifiably be deceived or deprived of information. 
Requiring that birth certificates record the truth does not impinge on
recipient parents' lives in any way but it safeguards information which
properly belongs to the offspring.  Including the name of the donor as well
as the fact of donor conception is the only means by which donor offsprings'
rights and their dignity as people can be honoured.</p>
